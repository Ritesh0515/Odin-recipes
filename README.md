#Odin-Recipes

This is a basic HTML project I'm building as a part of The Odin Project.It's simple recipe website where I'm adding a few of my favourite dishes.

Right now , it's all built using just plain HTML - no CSS or Javascript yet. The goal is to practice structuring web pages properly,linking between them,and using basic tags like images,headings,lists and paragaraphs.

##Recipe Added
-Puran Poli
-Chicken Biryani
-Butter Chicken
-(More to Come!)

Each recipe has an image, a short description,the ingredients,and the steps to make it 

#What I'm learning
-Writing clean HTML structure
-Creating multiple pages and linking them
-Organizing files into folders(like a real project)
-Using Git and Github to manage my code and push changes online

This is just a start - I'll improve the look and feel later when i learn the CSS.
